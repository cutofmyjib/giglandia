## giglandia
A small app that lets a user:
- sign in or sign up
- follow a band or bands
- lets user see a band's upcoming shows

[Check it out here](http://giglandia.herokuapp.com/)

I used Jquery mobile to get the look up and running. I used the [Songkick API](http://www.songkick.com/developer) to get information about artists and [Echonest](http://developer.echonest.com/) for artist thumbnails.
